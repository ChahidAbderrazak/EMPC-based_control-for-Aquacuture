# Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) towards precision Aquaculture system
Evaluate four candidate MPC formulations for fish growth reference tracking based on the receding horizon. The first MPC formulation tracks a desired fish growth trajectory while penalizing the feed ration, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. The second MPC optimization strategy directly optimizes the feed conversion ratio (FCR), which is the ratio between food quantity and fish weight gain at each sampling time.
